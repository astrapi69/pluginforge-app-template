# Contributing to MyApp

Thank you for considering a contribution. MyApp is a
project skeleton template built on PluginForge. The skeleton
ships with a working full-stack foundation; most non-trivial
features should land as plugins, not core changes.

## Project Layout

- `backend/` - FastAPI app, SQLAlchemy models, Alembic migrations
- `frontend/` - React + TypeScript + Vite
- `plugins/` - empty placeholder + plugin loader (zero plugins ship)
- `launcher/` - Cross-platform launcher (PyInstaller)
- `docs/` - Project documentation (CONCEPT, ROADMAP, configuration)
- `.claude/rules/` - Project rules read on demand
- `e2e/` - Playwright smoke + full suites

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or newer
- Node.js 24 (Active LTS; 20.19+ also works for tests but the
  full Vite 8 build requires 24)
- Poetry (Python dependency management)
- Docker + Docker Compose v2+ (for the prod-shape integration
  flow; not required for `make dev`)

### Bootstrap

```bash
git clone https://github.com/astrapi69/pluginforge-app-template.git
cd myapp
make install      # Poetry + npm + plugin path-deps
make test         # baseline; should be green before you start
make dev          # backend on :8000, frontend on :5173
```

`make help` lists every available target. The
[Makefile](Makefile) is the canonical source of truth for build
commands - this file references targets that exist there; do
not invent new ones in PRs without adding them to the Makefile
in the same change.

### Running tests

```bash
make test                     # all tests (backend + plugins + frontend)
make test-backend             # backend only
make test-frontend            # Vitest only
make check-types              # mypy + tsc --noEmit
```

When you add plugins, wire each into a `test-plugin-<name>`
target and aggregate via `test-plugins` (see the comment block
in the Makefile for the pattern).

## Plugin Development

MyApp plugins are standalone Poetry packages that register
through PluginForge ^0.10.0 entry points. New format-specific
or workflow-specific features generally belong in a plugin, not
in core.

### Quickstart

The template ships zero plugins; copy [`plugins/README.md`](plugins/README.md)
for the minimal skeleton.

```
plugins/myapp-plugin-yourname/
  pyproject.toml                # name, version, pluginforge dep, entry point
  myapp_yourname/
    __init__.py
    plugin.py                   # YourPlugin(BasePlugin)
    routes.py                   # FastAPI APIRouter (optional)
  tests/                        # pytest tests
  README.md
```

Steps:

1. Create the directory at `plugins/myapp-plugin-yourname/`.
2. Edit `pyproject.toml`: package name, description, the
   `[tool.poetry.plugins."myapp.plugins"]` entry point.
3. Implement `plugin.py` extending `BasePlugin` with `name`,
   `version`, `api_version = "1"`, `license_tier = "core"`, and
   `target_application = "myapp"`. Override `activate()`,
   `get_routes()`, `get_frontend_manifest()` as needed.
4. Add a path-dep in `backend/pyproject.toml` for the new
   plugin.
5. Add the plugin slug to `backend/config/app.yaml` under
   `plugins.enabled`.
6. If your plugin has runtime settings, drop them at
   `backend/config/plugins/{slug}.yaml` (PluginForge reads from
   there, not from inside the plugin's own dir).
7. `cd backend && poetry lock && poetry install`, then
   `make test-plugin-{yourname}` (after adding the Makefile
   target).

### Plugin licensing

All plugins currently ship under MIT with
`license_tier = "core"`. A licensing layer in
`backend/app/licensing.py` exists but is dormant
(`LICENSING_ENABLED = False`); no plugin is gated at runtime
today. If a future plugin adopts a paid tier, source remains
public and licensing affects only runtime activation.

## Coding Standards

Project rules live in [`.claude/rules/`](.claude/rules/) and are
read on demand:

- [architecture.md](.claude/rules/architecture.md) - layered
  architecture, plugin structure, UI strategy
- [coding-standards.md](.claude/rules/coding-standards.md) -
  naming, function design, dependency policy
- [code-hygiene.md](.claude/rules/code-hygiene.md) - linting,
  pre-commit, error-handling architecture, API conventions
- [quality-checks.md](.claude/rules/quality-checks.md) - test
  pyramid, coverage targets, mutation testing
- [lessons-learned.md](.claude/rules/lessons-learned.md) - known
  pitfalls (testing, Alembic, plugin lockfiles, etc.)
- [ai-workflow.md](.claude/rules/ai-workflow.md) - session
  workflow, documentation protocol
- [release-workflow.md](.claude/rules/release-workflow.md) -
  release process

The pre-commit hooks (ruff, ruff-format, trailing-whitespace,
end-of-file, YAML/JSON validation) run automatically on
`git commit`. Install them once with
`cd backend && poetry run pre-commit install`.

### Internationalization

MyApp ships catalogs under `backend/config/i18n/{lang}.yaml`.
The directory listing is the canonical list of supported
languages. Every user-facing change must add or update keys in
every catalog. Parity tests fail the build if a key is missing
in any language.

German content (i18n catalogs, help docs, README-de) uses real
UTF-8 umlauts. ASCII transliterations like `fuer`, `ueber`,
`oeffentlich` are forbidden in German user-facing text.

## Commit Conventions

MyApp uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
There is no commit-msg-time tool enforcing this; the convention
is documentation-only and reinforced through code review.

Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`,
`chore`. Provide a scope when one is obvious:
`feat(export): ...`, `fix(editor): ...`.

Atomic commits. Each commit must leave the tree green
(`make test` passes); intermediate commits with broken tests
break bisect. Combine source + test changes in the same commit
when splitting them would create a red intermediate state.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. Branch: `git checkout -b feat/short-name` or
   `fix/short-name`.
3. Make changes; keep commits atomic.
4. Run `make test` and `make check-types` locally; both must be
   green.
5. Push and open a PR. The PR template asks for type, testing
   evidence, doc updates, and plugin impact.

For larger changes, open an issue first to discuss design. Use
the
[Feature Request](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml)
template.
