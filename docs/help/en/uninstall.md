# Uninstalling MyApp

There are two ways to uninstall MyApp, depending on how you installed it.

## Path A: Launcher (all platforms)

If you installed MyApp using one of the launchers ([Windows](launcher-windows.md), [macOS](launcher-macos.md), or [Linux](launcher-linux.md)):

1. Open the MyApp launcher.
2. Click **Uninstall**.
3. Confirm when prompted.

The launcher removes the installation directory and its own manifest. Docker volumes (your book data) are preserved by default.

If uninstall is interrupted (process killed, Docker locked files, power loss), the launcher writes `cleanup.json` at the start and marks each step as complete. On next launch, the launcher silently retries any step still marked incomplete.

To also remove Docker volumes and images, run the commands in the "What gets removed" section below.

## Path B: Script (all platforms)

If you installed via `install.sh` or want a complete removal including Docker resources:

```bash
cd ~/myapp
bash uninstall.sh
```

The script asks for confirmation before removing anything. Type `yes` to proceed.

## What gets removed

The uninstall script removes:

| Component | Location | Command |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Docker containers | Running stack | `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down` |
| Docker volumes | Book data, database | `docker volume ls --filter name=myapp -q \| xargs docker volume rm` |
| Docker images | Backend + frontend images | `docker images --filter reference='*myapp*' -q \| xargs docker image rm` |
| Launcher manifest | Platform config dir | See below |
| Installation directory | `~/myapp` (default) | `rm -rf ~/myapp` |

Launcher manifest locations:
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\myapp\install.json`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/myapp/install.json`
- Linux: `~/.config/myapp/install.json`

## Keeping your data

If you want to keep your books before uninstalling:

1. Open MyApp in the browser
2. Go to the Dashboard
3. Use **Backup** to export each book as a `.bgb` file
4. Save the `.bgb` files somewhere safe
5. Then uninstall

After reinstalling, use **Restore** to import the `.bgb` files back.
